## Testing Recommendations

After merging PR #11, please verify:

### 1. Upload Test
- Upload a BMS screenshot
- Verify job is created and moves through statuses: Queued â†’ Processing â†’ Completed
- Check Netlify function logs for proper invocation chain

### 2. Job Processing
- Monitor `process-analysis` logs for successful data extraction
- Verify jobs complete within expected timeframe (< 60 seconds)
- Check for any stuck jobs in "Queued" or "Processing" status

### 3. Datalog Association
- **Automatic:** Upload image with known DL number, verify auto-association
- **Manual:** Assign unlinked record to system, verify association
- Verify DL numbers are added to system's `associatedDLs` array

### 4. Job Shepherd
- Monitor scheduled runs (every 5 minutes)
- Verify queued jobs are picked up and processed
- Check zombie job detection for any stuck jobs
- Verify circuit breaker functions correctly

### 5. Historical Chart
- Verify chart renders without errors
- Test averaging controls (on/off toggle, bucket selector)
- Verify legend displays correctly for all metric types
- Test both timeline and hourly views
