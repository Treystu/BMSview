## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Rate Limiting & Circuit Breaker
```javascript
- Token bucket: 60 requests/minute (configurable)
- Circuit breaker: Opens after 5 failures
- Exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → ...
- RetryInfo parsing: Honors Gemini's retry-after headers
```

### Database Optimization
```javascript
- Connection pooling: 2-10 connections (configurable)
- Query projection: Only fetch required fields
- Strategic indexes: 12 indexes across 3 collections
- Caching: 1-second TTL for status queries
```

### Logging & Observability
```javascript
- Structured JSON logs
- Request ID tracing
- Performance metrics
- Stage-by-stage tracking
```
