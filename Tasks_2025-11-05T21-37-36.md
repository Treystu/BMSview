# Ultimate AI Battery Guru Completion Checklist

- [x] Extend `summarizeContextForClient` to expose snapshot deltas, budget highlights, forecasts, and anomaly counts for front-end consumption
- [x] Update `generate-insights-status.cjs` to include `contextSummary` in polling responses
- [x] Enhance `services/clientService.ts` streaming to render a “Guru Context Primer” prior to AI output and during background polling
