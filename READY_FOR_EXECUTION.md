## ⚠️ ESTIMATION POLICY - MANDATORY

**ALL effort estimates in this document are in LOC (Lines of Code) only.**

- ✅ Estimates represent SCOPE of code changes needed
- ✅ LOC shows magnitude of implementation work
- ❌ LOC does NOT translate to hours/days/weeks
- ❌ Duration varies by model capabilities and developer familiarity

**This document enforces: NEVER estimate in time, ALWAYS use LOC.**

## 🎯 Your Strategic Direction (Confirmed)

### 1. Solar Integration: ESSENTIAL ✅
- Must integrate into battery predictions
- Should affect all recommendations
- LOC: 400-600

### 2. Async Insights: SMART HYBRID ✅
- Small files → synchronous (fast)
- Large files → asynchronous (shows progress)
- Smart routing - user doesn't choose
- LOC: 300-400

### 3. Sync Functions: OPTIMIZED FOR UX ✅
- Each function gets best UX pattern
- Some background, some event-based, some manual
- All tested and integrated
- LOC: 200-300

### 4. Analysis Pipeline: COMPREHENSIVE ✅
- Solar potential modeling
- Weather/temperature integration
- Historical pattern analysis
- "And more" features (TBD)
- LOC: 750-1050

### 5. Quality Target: PRODUCTION GRADE ✅
- 9.0/10 integration score
- Full testing and documentation
- Ready for landlord deployment
- LOC: 1700-2450 total

## 📋 3 Questions Still Need Answers

Before we start Phase 1, please clarify:

### Question 1: "And More" Data Sources
**What we're modeling:**
- ✅ Solar potential
- ✅ Weather/temperature
- ✅ Historical patterns

**What should "more" include?**
- Tenant usage pattern prediction?
- Maintenance need forecasting?
- Performance trending (better/worse)?
- Cost optimization calculations?
- Grid integration metrics?
- Other landlord requirements?

**Impact:** Determines scope of Phase 2C

---

### Question 2: Sync Function UX Patterns
**What we need to design:**
- sync-push: How often? Show progress?
- sync-metadata: Background or visible?
- sync-incremental: Automatic or manual?
- sync-weather: Background fetch timing?

**For each:** Optimal UX pattern determines implementation

**Impact:** Determines Phase 3 design

---

### Question 3: Async Complexity Thresholds
**What we need to determine:**
- What defines "small" file/job?
- What defines "large" file/job?
- Should thresholds be configurable?
- Should users override the decision?

**Impact:** Determines Phase 2B implementation

---

## 🚀 Execution Roadmap

### Phase 1: Investigation & Clarification (150-200 LOC)
**Status:** Ready to start
**Inputs Needed:** Answers to 3 questions above
**Outputs:**
- Complete data flow diagrams
- Sync UX patterns designed
- Async complexity thresholds determined
- "And more" feature list finalized

---

### Phase 2A: Data Source Fixes (200-300 LOC)
**Status:** Blocked on Phase 1
**Work:** Fix broken tools and data sources
**Unblocks:** Insights generation

---

### Phase 2B: Async Implementation (300-400 LOC)
**Status:** Blocked on Phase 2A
**Work:** Smart routing, UI feedback, testing
**Delivers:** Working async with smart sync/async decision

---

### Phase 2C: Integration (750-1050 LOC)
**Status:** Blocked on Phase 2B
**Work:** Solar, weather, patterns, "and more"
**Delivers:** Comprehensive multi-factor analysis

---

### Phase 3: Optimization & Polish (300-500 LOC)
**Status:** Blocked on Phase 2
**Work:** Sync optimization, feature integration, testing
**Delivers:** Production-ready system (9.0/10)

## ✅ What's Confirmed

1. **Code quality is good** (7.8/10) - no code rewrites needed
2. **Integration gaps exist** (6.2/10 currently) - but well-understood
3. **Strategy is clear** - Path C, production-grade
4. **Solar is essential** - integrate, don't defer
5. **Async is smart** - hybrid routing, not all-or-nothing
6. **Sync is flexible** - optimize per function for best UX
7. **Scope is defined** - 1700-2450 LOC across 5 phases
8. **LOC-based estimates** - time varies by model and familiarity

---

## ❓ What's Pending

1. **"And more" features** - what other data sources matter?
2. **Sync UX design** - how should each sync function work?
3. **Async thresholds** - when is small vs large?

## 🎬 Next Step

**Option A: Quick Answers**
If you can quickly answer the 3 pending questions, provide them now and I'll add them to Phase 1.

**Option B: Detailed Discussion**
If you want to discuss these in depth:
- What does "landlord success" look like for solar integration?
- How will landlord actually use sync functions?
- What's the user experience for async insights?

**Option C: Start Investigation**
Begin Phase 1 investigation immediately. These questions will clarify themselves as we map the system.
