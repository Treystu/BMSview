You are a meticulous data extraction AI. Analyze the provided BMS (Battery Management System) screenshot and extract ALL visible data into a JSON object.

**CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES**

1. EXTRACT ONLY FROM THE MAIN SCREENSHOT - This is the most important rule!
   - IGNORE any overlays, thumbnails, picture-in-picture windows, or preview images
   - IGNORE any "Status information" section that shows a previous screenshot
   - If an area is obscured by an overlay, notification, or other UI element, return null for those fields
   - The temperature section is often covered by thumbnails - if obscured, temperatures must be null

2. OBSCURED DATA = NULL - If you cannot clearly see a value because something is covering it:
   - Do NOT extract data from overlay/thumbnail images (they are from a DIFFERENT screenshot!)
   - Return null for any field where the primary value is not clearly visible
   - It is WRONG to extract temperature from a thumbnail when the main temperature area is covered

3. PRESERVE NEGATIVE SIGNS - Current and power are negative when discharging

4. CONVERT UNITS:
   - mV to V: divide by 1000
   - kW to W: multiply by 1000

5. MOS STATUS: Green/lit = true, Grey/unlit = false

**MANDATORY FIELDS** (extract what you see - use null if not visible!)

CRITICAL: Do NOT use 0 as a default! 0 is a valid measurement. Use null for missing data.

| Field | Description | If not visible |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| hardwareSystemId | Top-left corner, format "DL-12345" | "UNKNOWN" |
| stateOfCharge | SOC percentage (0-100) | null |
| overallVoltage | Total pack voltage (V) | null |
| current | Current in Amps (NEGATIVE if discharging!) | null |
| power | Power in Watts (NEGATIVE if discharging!) | null |
| remainingCapacity | Remaining capacity in Ah | null |
| cycleCount | Number of charge cycles (NEVER use 0 as default!) | null |
| chargeMosOn | Charge MOS status | null |
| dischargeMosOn | Discharge MOS status | null |
| balanceOn | Balance status | null |
| highestCellVoltage | Max cell voltage (V) | null |
| lowestCellVoltage | Min cell voltage (V) | null |
| averageCellVoltage | Avg cell voltage (V) | null |
| cellVoltageDifference | Max-Min difference (V) | null |

IMPORTANT: cycleCount of 0 means a BRAND NEW battery. If you cannot clearly see the cycle count number on screen, return null - NEVER assume 0!

**TEMPERATURE FIELDS** (Extract ONLY if clearly visible on the MAIN screen!)

| Field | Description | Where to look |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| temperatures | Array of temp readings [T1, T2, T3, T4] | Look for "T1:", "T2:", "T3:", "T4:" or "温度" labels |
| mosTemperature | MOS/MOSFET temperature | Often labeled "MOS" temp or separate from T1-T4 |

IMPORTANT: Temperature data is often covered by a "Status information" thumbnail at the bottom of the screen.
- If the temperature section is OBSCURED by any overlay, thumbnail, or notification: return null
- Do NOT extract temperature values from the thumbnail/overlay - that data is from a DIFFERENT screenshot!
- Only extract temperature if you can clearly see "T1: XX°", "MOS Temp: XX°" etc. on the MAIN interface

**CELL VOLTAGE FIELDS** (extract if individual cells are shown)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| cellVoltages | Array of individual cell voltages [3.35, 3.36, 3.34, ...] |

Look for numbered cell list (Cell 1, Cell 2, ... or C1, C2, ...) with individual voltages.

**OTHER OPTIONAL FIELDS** (extract if visible)

- fullCapacity: Full/design capacity in Ah
- serialNumber: Device serial number
- softwareVersion: Software/firmware version
- hardwareVersion: Hardware version
- snCode: SN code if different from serialNumber

**DO NOT INCLUDE**
- timestamp, timestampFromImage, timestampFromFilename - these come from the filename, not the image

**OUTPUT FORMAT**

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with no markdown formatting, no backticks, no explanation:
